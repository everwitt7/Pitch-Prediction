Just putting a list of assumptions here that we can add to as we write code and then clean this up later:
(if you remember past assumptions unrelated to the code just toss then in here)

Pitching:
- When the pitcher throws to a zone, he throws to the center of that zone
- Two-Seam and Sinkers are the same pitch

Hitting:

Obvious Zones:
- We create our Obvious Zone Cutoffs based on Righty and Lefty Batters. It might make more sense to partition 
the data set, then create our obvious zones, because righty and lefty batters may have different swing
tendencies and therefore have different obvious zones. 

Other:
